# WorldsAdriftReborn

# About
Worlds Adrift Reborn is a community made mod in an attempt to revive the Worlds Adrift game with a Dedicated server option.
This means anyone would be able to host his/her own server and let other people join in.

# Current state
As you might guessed this is a very eager project. The game heavily relies on proprietary code for its networking (SpatialOS) and we need to replace it with our own implementation.
We can't say for sure if this project will succeed but we will do our best for it.

## Boot the game
The Game cannot be purchased anymore so we patched out the need to have steam running (for now) as well as a few other checks made when the game starts.
This way we can reach the main menu.

We use [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) and [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to patch the game at runtime, you can find the mod project [here](https://github.com/sp00ktober/WorldsAdriftReborn/tree/main/WorldsAdriftReborn)

## Main Menu
The game communicates with a HTTP REST server when you perform actions in the main menu. This is the "WorldsAdriftServer" project that you can find [here](https://github.com/sp00ktober/WorldsAdriftReborn/tree/main/WorldsAdriftServer)
So far you can get to the character creation screen and choose one of the hardcoded characters to enter the game.

## In Game
After the intro video the game usually bootstraps its SpatialOs networking. To replace it with our own implementation we made a C++ project that you can find [here](https://github.com/sp00ktober/WorldsAdriftReborn/tree/main/WorldsAdriftRebornCoreSdk).
This will compile into a .dll and you can use it to replace the original one located at `gameroot\UnityClient@Windows_Data\Plugins\CoreSdkDll.dll`.

Our implementation offers the same methods as SpatialOs does. This means the game still thinks its talking to the SpatialOs dll while it is infact calling our own methods. This will allow us to implement our own networking.

At the moment we can instruct the game to load and spawn entities this way, the next thing will be to add and update their components to get a similar result as the one you see in the last video found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qpqRZ9W9GE)
